Well hello everyone reading this!

## My main interests in programming are:

Overall I just love to experiment with hardware and software and see what happens.
Also very ambitious.

-  Very secret project, will publish it when time is right. 
-  Open source grand strategy game based on repository named "Symphony of empires".

## My favourite programming languages:
- C
- C++
- Nim (perhaps the most underrated programming language ever!)

## Other things about me:

- Currently studying at high school in Finland.
    - Only one year remains, then I am completely free.
- Currently unemployed, would want to get a job.
- Self taught programmer

  ### My preferred languages to communicate with:
